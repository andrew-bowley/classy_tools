/**
 * UserTask
 * @author Romain Guy
 * 25/04/2014
  * <p>UserTask enables proper and easy use of the UI thread. This class allows to
 * perform background operations and publish results on the UI thread without
 * having to manipulate threads and/or handlers.</p>
 *
 * <p>A user task is defined by a computation that runs on a background thread and
 * whose result is published on the UI thread. A user task is defined by 3 generic
 * types, called <code>Params</code>, <code>Progress</code> and <code>Result</code>,
 * and 4 steps, called <code>begin</code>, <code>doInBackground</code>,
 * <code>processProgress</code> and <code>end</code>.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <p>UserTask must be subclassed to be used. The subclass will override at least
 * one method ({@link BackgroundTask#doInBackground()}), and most often will override a
 * second one ({@link BackgroundTask#onPostExecute(Boolean)}.)</p>
 *
 * <p>Here is an example of subclassing:</p>
 * <pre>
 * private class DownloadFilesTask extends UserTask&lt;URL, Integer, Long&gt; {
 *     public File doInBackground(URL... urls) {
 *         int count = urls.length;
 *         long totalSize = 0;
 *         for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
 *             totalSize += Downloader.downloadFile(urls[i]);
 *             publishProgress((int) ((i / (float) count) * 100));
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     public void onProgressUpdate(Integer... progress) {
 *         setProgressPercent(progress[0]);
 *     }
 *
 *     public void onPostExecute(Long result) {
 *         showDialog("Downloaded " + result + " bytes");
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Once created, a task is executed very simply:</p>
 * <pre>
 * new DownloadFilesTask().execute(new URL[] { ... });
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>User task's generic types</h2>
 * <p>The three types used by a user task are the following:</p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li><code>Params</code>, the type of the parameters sent to the task upon
 *     execution.</li>
 *     <li><code>Progress</code>, the type of the progress units published during
 *     the background computation.</li>
 *     <li><code>Result</code>, the type of the result of the background
 *     computation.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>Not all types are always used by a user task. To mark a type as unused,
 * simply use the type {@link Void}:</p>
 * <pre>
 * private class MyTask extends UserTask&lt;Void, Void, Void&gt; { ... }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>The 4 steps</h2>
 * <p>When a user task is executed, the task goes through 4 steps:</p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@link BackgroundTask#onPreExecute()}, invoked on the UI thread immediately after the task
 *     is executed. This step is normally used to setup the task, for instance by
 *     showing a progress bar in the user interface.</li>
 *     <li>{@link BackgroundTask#doInBackground()}, invoked on the background thread
 *     immediately after {@link BackgroundTask#onPreExecute ()} finishes executing. This step is used
 *     to perform background computation that can take a long time. The parameters
 *     of the user task are passed to this step. The result of the computation must
 *     be returned by this step and will be passed back to the last step. This step
 *     can also use {@link #publishProgress(Object[])} to publish one or more units
 *     of progress. These values are published on the UI thread, in the
 *     {@link #onProgressUpdate(Object[])} step.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #onProgressUpdate (Object[])}, invoked on the UI thread after a
 *     call to {@link #publishProgress(Object[])}. The timing of the execution is
 *     undefined. This method is used to display any form of progress in the user
 *     interface while the background computation is still executing. For instance,
 *     it can be used to animate a progress bar or show logs in a text field.</li>
 *     <li>{@link BackgroundTask#onPostExecute(Boolean)}, invoked on the UI thread after the background
 *     computation finishes. The result of the background computation is passed to
 *     this step as a parameter.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Threading rules</h2>
 * <p>There are a few threading rules that must be followed for this class to
 * work properly:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The task instance must be created on the UI thread.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #execute(BackgroundTask)} must be invoked on the UI thread.</li>
 *     <li>Do not call {@link BackgroundTask#onPreExecute ()}, {@link BackgroundTask#onPostExecute(Boolean)},
 *     {@link BackgroundTask#doInBackground()}, {@link #onProgressUpdate (Object[])}
 *     manually.</li>
 *     <li>The task can be executed only once (an exception will be thrown if
 *     a second execution is attempted.)</li>
 * </ul>
