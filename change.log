Classy Tools v1.0.2

1. Refactor database classes in classydb package to provide consistency between Java and Android database management. 

This increases support provided for ORMLite special connections used in Android onCreate and onUpgrade handling.

* OpenHelperCallbacks interface moved to classyjava project.
* Default OpenHelperCallbacks implementation changed from ClassyOpenHelperCallbacks to OpenHelperCallbacksImpl.
* OpenHelperCallbacksImpl is a JPA Persistence Container - runs in the same thread as caller, uses a provided ConnectionSource.
* DatabaseSupport interface increased with addition of database version accessors. 
* Detection of change of version triggers onCreate and onUpgrade events for non-Android databases.
* Added SQL script file(s) for datbase upgrades. A default naming convention applies which incorporates old and new version numbers. 
* DatabaseAdmin DATABASE_VERSION changed from "database_version" to "database-version"
* New DatabaseAdmin UPGRADE_FILENAME_FORMAT for custom upgrade file names
* OpenEventHandler is a new SQLiteOpenHelper implementation class which manages ORMLite special connections 
* DatabaseAdminImpl.initializeDatabase() now runs on same thread as caller.

2. New HelloTwoDbs project for Java implementation of Android counterpart.

* Unit test demonstrates datbase version upgrade case for two databases.

3. Change Robolectric version from 2.4-SNAPSHOT to 2.4

* Removed installation of SNAPSHOT files to local repository

4. Added configuration to Classy Tools pom.xml for reporting an aggregate JavaDocs site

* The site will be published at http://cybersearch2.com.au/apidocs/ so external links work for project JavaDocs.

5. WorkTracker in classytask package has new waitForTask() methods

* The waitForTask implementation transferred from DatabaseAdminImpl after refactor.
* Optional taskName added for timeout error reporting.

6. PersistenceFactory new initializeAllDatabases() method to be called on application start up

Note: initializeAllDatabases() method is sychronous and will propgate any RuntimeException thrown

* Provides a context in which database onCreate and onUpgrade events happen
* Existing test and sample code updated to call new method

Classy Tools v1.0.3

1. Update included OrmLite library jars to pre-v1.49 release (03/15 build)
2. Enhance PersistenceContainer class to support synchronous operation.

Default is run persistence task in background thread but will now run in caller's thread
if new constructor "async" flag is set false or ConnectionSource with single connection detected  eg.
default OrmLite JdbcConnectionSource. The executeTask() return Executable object now has
waitForTask() method which should always be used for synchrous call to hide how
the PersistenceContainer is behaving.

3. Create new PersistenceContext class.

This is to hide PersistenceFactory dependency injection from all the classes dependent on it.
This solves annotation processing link error generated when compiling the ClassyFy Android app.
PersistenceContext has 2 methods to dynamically update the configuration of a persistence unit
to support database up/down-grade. See HelloTwoDbsUpgradeTest in hello-two-dbs-example project.

4. Create new PersistenceLoader class.

This replaces LoaderPersistenceContainer and LoaderTaskImpl in a refactor to take advantage
of PersistenceContainer's new synchronous cabability.

5. Fix bug in database upgrade code.

It was not updating database version except for version 0 to 1 upgrade.
